# Sales Catalog

This project is a sample CRUD for  products. I built this API for studying purposes and for testing artchitectures models and concepts about CQRS.

The stack used is:

- .net 5.0
- XUnit
- FluentAssertions
- MediatR
- SqlServer
- EntityFrameworkCore
- AutoMapper

The API's architecture uses concepts about:

- Clean Architecture
- CQRS
